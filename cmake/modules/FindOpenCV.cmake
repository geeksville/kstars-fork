# - Try to find OpenCV
# Once done this will define
#
#  OpenCV_FOUND - system has OpenCV
#  OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIR - the OpenCV include directory
#  OpenCV_LIBRARIES - Link these to use OpenCV
#
# Currently the following OpenCV libraries are used
#   opencv_core - core
#   opencv_imageproc - image processing routines, e.g. Sobel, Laplassian, etc
#   opencv_highgui - used for debug (when stable this could be removed)
#   JEE tidy up
#
# OpenCV is installed in /opencv4/opencv2/.. and the include path needs to be at the /opencv4 level
# to avoid compilation errors
