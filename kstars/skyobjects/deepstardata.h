// TODO: Think about how to improve this data block to include
// parallaxes without changing the struct's memory and disk footprint.
//
// RA and Dec combined to a resolution of 0.1Â° comprise of 46.3 bits
// of information, so there is scope to pack more by using some
// boutiqe encoding... The remaining 17 bits should be able to
// accommodate the parallax. Perhaps creating a qint16[4] data block
// that can be bitmasked to read RA, Dec and parallax is a future goal
